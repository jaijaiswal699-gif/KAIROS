# KAIROS

**Καιρός** — The Right Moment.

A minimalist, philosophical time-locked community treasury built on Ethereum.

## Project Description

KAIROS is an immutable smart contract that allows anyone to deposit ETH into a shared treasury that can only be unlocked after a predefined moment in time — the "Kairos".

Inspired by ancient Greek philosophy, where **Chronos** refers to sequential time and **Kairos** refers to the qualitative, opportune moment, this contract embodies patience, collective trust, and the belief that certain things are worth waiting for.

Think of it as a digital time capsule for value — a communal chest that opens only when the time is right.

## Project Vision

To create small rituals of patience and shared destiny on the blockchain.  
In a world of instant gratification, KAIROS reminds us that some moments — and some treasures — are more valuable when they arrive exactly when they are meant to.

## Key Features

- **Time-locked treasury** — Funds can only be withdrawn after the chosen `UNLOCK_TIMESTAMP`
- **Anyone can contribute** — No permission needed to deposit ETH
- **Transparent purpose** — The creator can set and update the vision/purpose of this Kairos
- **Single withdrawal** — When the moment comes, everything is released to the chosen recipient
- **Philosophical minimalism** — Clean, auditable, no upgrades, no hidden tricks

## Future Scope

- Multiple Kairos instances (factory pattern)
- NFT "Moments" minted when depositing (proof of participation)
- DAO-governed unlock conditions
- Support for ERC20 tokens and NFTs inside the vault
- Integration with prediction markets ("Will we make it to the moment?")
- Physical world unlock ceremonies synced with on-chain events

The right time is coming.  
Are you ready?
